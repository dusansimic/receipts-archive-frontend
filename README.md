# Receipts Archive Frontend 📃

> Frontend for Receipts Archive written in Vue.js.

## Install dependencies

This project uses yarn for package management. It's not tested with npm!

```sh
yarn install
```

## Start

Start the development server with the following command.
```sh
yarn serve
```

I would recommend you to use this with this with a development environment I use.
[Here](https://gitlab.com/makerns/receipts-archive/development) you can find information on how to
set it up. You'll need to use Docker for this. You are not forced to use it but this will make
development environment similar to the deployment environment and it's easier to run it this way.

## Run tests

```sh
yarn test
```

The tests include linting which is done with [XO](https://github.com/xojs/xo) linter.
